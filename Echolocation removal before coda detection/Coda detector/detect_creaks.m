function Creaks=detect_creaks(Locs,Pks)
%   AUTHOR:         Guy Gubnitsky
%   DATE:           February 2024
%   DESCRIPTION:

%   This function gets a vector of arrival times and avector of peak amplitudes 
%   of M transients and outputs a vector containing the indices of suspected sperm whale creaks 
%   Note: this is an optional function based on a hueristic approach which is not described
%   in the associated paper. This approach searches a sequence of high
%   rhyrhm clicks of roughly similar peak amplitudes.

%   INPUT:
%   > Locs                  - Vector of 1XM with time of arrival in seconds for M identified transients
%   > Pks                   - Vector of 1XM containing the peaks of M identified transients

%   OUTPUT:
%   > Creaks            - Vector of 1XW with indices of suspected sperm whale coda clicks
